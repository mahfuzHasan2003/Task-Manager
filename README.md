# Task Manager

## Short Description

This Task Management Application allows users to manage their tasks seamlessly. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks across three categories: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. The app features real-time updates using Socket.io and a clean, responsive UI built with React, Shadcn/ui & Tailwind CSS.
